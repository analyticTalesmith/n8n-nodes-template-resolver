# Unknown names are always errors, strict mode governs missing data

**Context.** Unknown filters throw today but unknown identifiers followed by operators silently evaluate false, and strict mode mixes missing data with misspelled names.

**Decision.** A filter, operator or identifier that the language does not define is a syntax-level error in every mode. Strict mode decides only what happens when a defined variable has no value in the data.

**Alternatives.** Report unknown names as errors in strict mode only; rejected because a typo then passes silently in the default mode.

**Consequences.** Typos are caught before a run by validate and analyze. Missing data stays tolerant by default.
